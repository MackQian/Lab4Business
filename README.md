# Lab4Business

Our idea for a business model centered around Open Source is in XYZ. Users can download a free, bare-bones version of the software that provides basic functionality for ABC. To profit, XYZ also offers customization options and tailored solutions that the user can pay for. They then have access to the software and source code of their custom functionality.
