# Lab4Business

Our idea for a business model centered around Open Source is in XYZ. Users can download a free, bare-bones version of the software that provides basic functionality for ABC. To profit, XYZ also offers support from consultants to help users best deploy xyz. 

The license that would be most appropriate for this business is the MIT License because the user is free to distribute and modify any extensions that they paid for and received, although it cannnot be guaranteed that it will function as well as it originally did.
