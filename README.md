# Lab4Business

Project Idea:

Our project relies on a hybrid business model. The open source component would involve creating a web framework that allows users to easily create full stack web applications. The goal would be to have a simple command line toolchain through which users can generate boilerplate for both their backend and frontend.

The way we would make money from this is by offering hosting, CI / CD pipelines, and support for projects made with this framework. We can also offer a marketplace through which third party developers can create (potentially monetized) add-ons for projects hosted through us. We would take a small cut of the money third party developerâ€™s make through our marketplace.

Hybrid licensing allows us to intermingle open source and proprietary code in a single product, and the entire repo would be available to the public.
Also, services and support can be monetized as well. For example, a user may be able to pay for support lines if required.
However, the core code is still available to the public and can be used and modified by anyone.

Picking the Apache license:
Similar to the reason Android and Hadoop use it
Unmodified code must stay under the Apache license, but any new modifications and code can be put with any other license, including proprietary licenses
This supports the idea of a marketplace, since monetizing add-ons would be possible under the Apache license.
